# Joomla! Policy Repository

An unofficial thought experiment for how the Joomla! project could manage policy and procedure via Github.

***

Joomla policies are everywhere except in a central place. Likewise, a lot of procedure and roles are known from experience and not written down. It is proposed that all Joomla (including possibly OSM) policy and procedure is located centrally in this Github repository with the view that the community is empowered to enact change through discussion and pull requests (compare https://github.com/unitedstates).

The goal is to record Joomla project policies (governing law if you like), procedures (how we perform duties), project roles and a small set of by-laws to govern the process of change. The goal is also to empower both the leadership and the community to be able to make change openly and transparently.
